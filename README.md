Maze Solver Visualization with Python and Curses
  This project is a simple maze solver visualization tool built with Python and the curses library. It uses a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest path from the start to the end of the maze and visually displays the search process step-by-step in the terminal.

Features:
  Maze Representation: The maze is represented as a 2D list, where # represents walls, O represents the start, and X represents the end.
  Breadth-First Search (BFS): Utilizes BFS to explore the maze and find the shortest path from start to end.
  Curses for Visualization: The curses library is used to display the maze and the search process in the terminal with colored paths.
  Step-by-Step Visualization: The algorithm's progress is shown step-by-step, allowing users to see how the path is found.
